# Biocompatible materials

- biocompatibility
- physical stability
- nontoxicity

## Artificial joints

- 10 ~ 15y
- Oxinium using Ziconium : 25 ~ 30y

## Artificial blood vessels

- Gore-Tex

  

### Characteristics of biosignals

- filter and amplifier is needed

  

### Charging medical device

- Ultrasound : above 20000Hz, human can’t hear
- ultrasonic transducer which use piezoelecetric material

  

# EMG

### Electromyography

- caused by muscle activity
- detect, amplify, records the potential difference of skeletal muscles
- luigi Galvani

  

### purpose

- research on magnitude of force by muscles
- timing when muscles express force
- degree of muscle fatigue due to repitition of movement

  

### motor unit

- group of muscle fibers controlled by one motor nerve

  

### Fourier Transform

- any form of signal can be expressed as a sum of sine functions with different frequencies

  

### Three types of muscles

- cardian muscle
- smooth muscle : hollow internal organs
- skeletal muscle 
    - fascia
    - muscle fibers
        
        - myofibrils
        
          
        

### contraction of muscle

- interaction of actin filaments and myosin filaments → motor unit
- resting potential → Action potential (main source of bioelectrical signals)
- polarized state → depolarization → repolarization

  

### muscle contraction

- isometric contraction : no visual change
- concentric contraction : shortening
- eccentric contraction : increasing

  

### measured signals might…

EMG might include signals from other muscles (cross talk)

  

### External noise

in order to detect clean EMG external noise should be removed

- Hum : caused by AC power
- Drift : change in the standard DC signals of body

→ Differential amplifiers are used

  

### Differential amplifiers

removes common mode signals and amplify differential mode signals

- common mode signal : external factors - signals whose phase changes with time are the same
- differential mode signal : signals whose phase changes with time are different

  

### electrode

should be located in the center of the muscle bundle, where a lot of muscle fibers gather

tendons should be avoided

motor points should be avoided

placed longitudinal direction of the muscle fibers

- surface
- insertion

  

# ECG

### structure of heart

![[/Untitled 29.png|Untitled 29.png]]

  

### 12 lead ECG

- limb lead : 6 from hands and feet (4 electrode)
- chest lead : 6 from chest (6 electrode)

  

### Myocardium

- special myocardium
- working myocardium

  

### sinus node

- 60 ~ 100 beats/min
- sinus node dominates the rhythm in a normal heart due to its fastest rhythm

  

### how ECG is made

- Willem Einthoven
- high wave : contraction (depolarization)  
    low wave : repolarization  
    
- Three law of ECG waveform
    - Law 1 : when excitement comes closer, wave rise, and when excitement moves away, wave goes down
    - Law 2 : greater amount of contracting myocardium, the higher wave
    - Law 3 : if it takes time for contraction to propagate, wave gets wider

  

### reading ECG

![[/Untitled 1 8.png|Untitled 1 8.png]]

- P wave : originate from atrium
- QRS : ventricular contraction (depolarization)
    - Q can be small
    - width of 0.1s or less is normal
- T : ventricular repolarization
    - downward wave is abnormal
- U : could be invisible
