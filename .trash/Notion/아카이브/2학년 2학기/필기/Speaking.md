I will describe a time when I demonstrated a good leadership skills.

  

During my sophomore year, I had to lead the introverted individuals and carry out the team project. Which was developing and designing a new item for potential sale.

  

The team, consisting of unfamiliar teammates, posed a unique hurdle as Decision-making required evaluating diverse opinions and fostering a unified perspective, but each member was reserved, avoiding volunteering or suggesting opinions assertively, and had hesitancy to criticize differing viewpoints.

  

Recognizing the necessity for coordinated leadership, I volunteered as the team leader.

As a team leader, My priority goal was to establish a shared vision.

So I initiated gathering teammates' opinions through taking the lead on expressing ideas,

directly questioning one by one. In particular, I was eager to hear the voices of those who were hesitating to share their opinions.

After gathering opinions I started offering constructive criticism. By doing so we integrated different opinions and set a unified goal.

I scheduled detail objectives and delegated tasks to teammates with the relevant skills according to our unified goals.

  

As a result our first team project concluded successfully, earning us an excellent grade from the professor.
